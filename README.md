## .NET MAUI Notes Tutorial

### Before starting

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) installed, along with the .NET Multi-platform App UI development workload.

Make sure that Visual Studio is up-to-date, and .NET 8 is available.

### What you'll accomplish

In this tutorial, you'll create an app where users can create simple notes, which will be locally stored.

This app will be cross-platform, and you can test it on Android, iOS, MacOS and Windows.

### Some considerations
To test your app in Windows, developer mode must be turned on. 
Head over to Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode (toggle this option).

To use an Android emulator, in Visual Studio, in the debug dropdown, select Android Emulator. 
You will be prompted to set up an Android emulator.

For iOS and MacOS testing, you must have a MacOS system in the same network as the host running Visual Studio.

### Credits
This tutorial is based on Microsoft's own [Notes Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/?view=net-maui-8.0). 

Some features coded in the original tutorial will not be implemented in class due to time constraints.
